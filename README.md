# qubes-app-linux-converter
In development, do not use it.

Goals before reaching any 'usable' state:
- Improve my skills in rust
- Provide all the functionnalities of "qubes-app-linux-pdf-converter"
- Provide all the functionnalities of my -- currently -- pull request https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-app-linux-pdf-converter/pull/9
- Provide most important functionnalities of "qubes-app-linux-img-converter"
- Add a basic GTK gui 
- Eventually try to raise my UI skills from 0 to non 0
- Archlinux, debian, fedora packaging for Qubes OS
- Split the software in 2 packages: client and server. The server will require
a lot of dependencies. So the goals is to be able to install the client (who
does not require a lot of dependencies) in a different Qubes Template VM than
the server.

Extended goals:
- Sound converter
